#+title: Woozie User Manual

* Overview

Woozie is a collection of emacs-lisp functions that aid in the creation and maintenance of Oozie workflows.
This library makes it easier to create workflow definitions and corresponding configuration files.
It can also be used to validate workflows.

* Environment Setup


Setting up Emacs to use this library is trivial.  All you have to do is download  =woozie.el= to your machine.
Then copy it to where you want it reside and add the following to your emacs configuration file (usually =.emacs= or =.emacs.d/init.el=):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "path/to/woozie.el")
#+END_SRC

And that is all there is to it. 
Several functions starting with =woozie-= are now available to aid you in creating, visualizing and validating Oozie workflows.

* Woozie Mode

Once the file is loaded, you can open a buffer where you will build your workflow XML definition and type =M-x woozie-mode=
which will set woozie-mode as the buffer's major mode.
This mode is an extension of the nXML mode included with Emacs for XML processing and extends it with key bindings for
creating, validating and visualizing workflows.

For documentation on the mode type =C-hm= when your current buffer is in woozie-mode.
All woozie key bindings starts with =C-cw=.

* Use Cases

So, what can Woozie help you with? Many things, it turns out.

** Workflow Creation

Suppose you want to create a workflow definition.
Open a buffer where you want to create the workflow file and type =M-x woozie-wf-mk=. 
Emacs will ask you for the job name to use and create a workflow XML skeleton.

Once you have your workflow skeleton,  the library makes it easy to insert actions.
All you have to do is select the appropriate =woozie-wf-action-*= function.
Calling these functions and providing a couple of parameters should be enough to generate the desired workflow elements.

The following functions are available for creating new actions:
+ =woozie-wf-action-shell= creates a new shell action.
+ =woozie-wf-action-hive= creates a new hive action
+ =woozie-wf-action-email= creates a new email action

Of particular interest is the =woozie-wf-action-hive= function. Not only does it create a new action, it also scans
the corresponding hive script looking for variables (marked by =hivevar:=) and adds them to the xml action definition.

There are also functions that help populate these actions with file, property and argument elements.
They are:
+ =woozie-wf-action-property=
+ =woozie-wf-action-argument=
+ =woozie-wf-action-file=

*** Configuration File Creation

To help with creating your configuration files, you can type =woozie-wf-show-vars= when inside the workflow xml buffer
and  you will get a new buffer with all the variables defined in the workflow.
If you are inside a hive buffer, =woozie-hive-show-vars= will list all the hive variables.

** Workflow Validation

Workflow creation is not the only area in which Woozie adds value.
It can also help by checking and validating the workflow you have created.

You can type  =M-x woozie-wf-validate= and it will check whether:
+ Action names are unique;
+ All transitions are valid;
+ All action nodes have an incoming transition.
+ All properties defined in the <parameters> element are unique;
+ All properties defined in the <parameters> element correspond to a variable in the workflow;
+ All variables present in the workflows have a corresponding entry in the <parameters> element. 

You can also check if the workflow with respect to its configuration file.
Type =M-x woozie-wf-validate-config=, passing the configuration file as a parameter and Emacs will list all 
the variables in the workflow definition that are missing from the configuration file, as well as
the variables in the config file that are not present in the workflow definition.


** Workflow Visualization

Woozie supports visualizing Oozie workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
If you have =dot=, or some other [[https://graphviz.org/][Graphviz]] tool installed, you can generate (and view) the graph in many different formats.
Limited support is provided for ASCII art visualization directly on Emacs.

NOTE: Currently workflow visualization supports only the generation of DAGs for the happy path.
Transitions resulting from errors are not shown.


*** Dot file visualization

If you have dot installed, (and in your path), you can visualize the workflow in the current buffer by running =woozie-wf-view-dag=.
This will ask for which image type you want to create (defaults to PNG) and display it in a new buffer.
Running it on our [[../testdata/simplegraphworkflow.xml][sample workflow]] will result in something like this:


[[./workflow.png]]

If you want more control, you can create a  [[https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html][DOT]] file describing the workflow by running =woozie-wf-mk-dot=.
Edit this file to your heart's content to change shapes, colors, labels and anything else you might want.
Save the file and then you can use it as input to [[https://graphviz.org/][Graphviz]] or some similar system to generate a workflow graph in several different formats.

For example, running =woozie-wf-mk-dot= on the example workflow generates the following output:
#+BEGIN_SRC
strict digraph {

  // nodes
 start [shape=doublecircle]
 Step1 
 TheSecondStep 
 StepC 
 TheEnd [shape=doublecircle]

  // transitions
  start -> Step1
  Step1 -> TheSecondStep
  TheSecondStep -> StepC
  StepC -> TheEnd
}
#+END_SRC

We can run it through the dot program to generate a png file by typing
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
dot -Tpng -oworkflow.png workflow.dot 
#+END_SRC


**** Changing the Color and Shape of Nodes in the Generated DOT File

If you don't like the shape and colors of the different nodes in your workflow graph, you can change them easily.
Just modify the variable =woozie-dot-node-attribs= and define the desired node attributes for the different workflow node types.
It stores an association (map) between node type and node attributes to use.
The default value of the variable is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (list  (cons 'start    "[shape=doublecircle]")
	(cons 'end      "[shape=doublecircle]")
	(cons 'action   "")
	(cons 'fork     "[shape=box]")
	(cons 'join     "[shape=box]")
	(cons 'decision "[shape=diamond]"))
#+END_SRC

You can change the value of the attributes of the list by adding them to the beginning of the list via =cons=.
For example, to change the color of action nodes to be red you could do the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (cons (cons 'action "[color=RED]") woozie-dot-node-attribs))
#+END_SRC

Thought not strictly necessary, you can remove the older key-value pair by calling =assq-delete-all= before adding the new value.


*** ASCII Visualization

Woozie also has the ability to generate a very limited ASCII art representation of the workflow by running =woozie-wf-mk-ascii= on the current workflow buffer.
As of this writing it is limited to creating only single path workflows, with no decision or fork/join nodes.
Running it on our example workflow resulted in the figure below:

#+BEGIN_SRC
      +-------+      
      | start |      
      +-------+      
          |          
      +-------+      
      | Step1 |      
      +-------+      
          |          
  +---------------+  
  | TheSecondStep |  
  +---------------+  
          |          
      +-------+      
      | StepC |      
      +-------+      
          |          
      +--------+     
      | TheEnd |     
      +--------+     
#+END_SRC


* What Is Coming Next?

Woozie still has a lot of room to grow. New features currently planned include:
+ User-defined templates for the different xml elements;
+ Improving ASCII visualization capabilities to include if-conditionals and fork/join;
+ Oozie cli commands for workflow management.
