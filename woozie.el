;;
;; ooziefuncs contains a collection of functions that simplify creating oozie workflows.
;; These include functions for:
;;    * adding actions tot the current workflow.xml buffer
;;    * extracting variable information from one (or more) workflow.xml files and adding
;;      them to a config buffer, which can then serve as the basis for creating a confi-
;;      guration file.
;;    * generating graph representations of the workflow
